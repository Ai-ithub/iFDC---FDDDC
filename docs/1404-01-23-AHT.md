## Reviewing the OLAG Software
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Researched the OLAG software.
  - Installed the software on the system.
  - Watched a video related to compressor modeling.
- **Notes**:
  - Despite efforts to learn and use this software, due to a lack of familiarity with the fundamentals of petroleum engineering and no expertise in this field, practical usage of the software was limited for me. This task is more suited for petroleum engineers.
