### Activities:
 #### GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) â€“ Learning and Implementation
* Studied the core principles of GANs and their application in synthetic data generation.


* Built and trained a basic GAN model.


* Encountered a GPU out-of-memory error during training.


### Next Steps:
* Troubleshoot and resolve GPU memory issues (optimize batch size, simplify architecture, or use memory-efficient methods).

* Start generating synthetic datasets for LWD, MWD, and CBL to support further modeling and experimentation.
