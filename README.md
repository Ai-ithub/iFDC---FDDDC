## üí° Formation Damage Monitoring System (FDMS)

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the intelligent FDMS system, which is responsible for real-time monitoring and prediction of formation damage during drilling and cementing operations. This system leverages MWD/LWD data, predefined validation rules, and machine learning algorithms.

### 1.2 System Scope
FDMS is an integrated software platform consisting of a data validation pipeline, predictive maintenance engine, machine learning models, and a real-time dashboard for monitoring key parameters. It is applicable to both onshore and offshore drilling environments and is intended to minimize formation damage and optimize operational decisions.

## 6. Machine Learning Details

### 6.1 Data Validation Logic
All incoming data is validated against predefined physical and logical rules:
- Acceptable range enforcement for all numeric features
- Type and unit conformity
- Automatic filling or removal of missing/invalid values
- Anomaly tagging for suspicious readings

### 6.2 Predictive Maintenance Models
The following models are used to predict and prevent formation damage:
- üî¢ **Regression Models**: Linear, Ridge, Polynomial
- üå≥ **XGBoost**: Gradient-boosted trees for tabular predictions
- üîÅ **LSTM & GRU**: Recurrent networks for sequential/temporal data

Each model is trained on labeled historical well data and evaluated using:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R¬≤ Score (Goodness-of-fit)

Model selection is automated based on performance per site or lithology type.
