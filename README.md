## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the intelligent FDMS system, which is responsible for real-time monitoring, 3D simulation, and prediction of formation damage during drilling and cementing operations. This system is developed using MWD/LWD data and machine learning.

### 1.2 System Scope
FDMS is designed as an integrated system comprising a data analysis engine, machine learning models, a 3D simulation engine, and an interactive management dashboard. The system is intended for real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and operational decision optimization in drilling and cementing processes and is applicable to both onshore and offshore environments.
